# Numpy Number Classifier
A simple neural network for the classification of the MNIST-Dataset consisting of one convolutional layer and 
two linear layers written from scratch, only using numpy. The optimization method is gradient descent 
(mini batch), the loss function is Cross Entropy Loss. 

Without hyperparameter tuning, classifier reached ~90% accuracy on the test dataset - just as proof of concept
